i got to know that we can also declare number datatype explicitly 
with help of new Number(100.2332)

this when we declare in browser console we get to see the property and conversion we can do on numbers 

we can convert it to string with toString()
we can use toFixed to fix the number of value after decimal 
when we use toFixed the number get converted to string we have to remember this 

then we understand  about the toPrecision(3) this will give only 3 value with approximations 
ex =123.899
when we use toPrecision(4)we get approx result 123.9

similar some times we can convert big number into money so we can read it easily 
with the help of toLocalString('en-us')->to convert it into million number system
