we have basic maths operation in javascipt 
console.log(2+2);
console.log(2-2);
console.log(2*2);
console.log(2/2);
console.log(2**2);
console.log(2%2);

but there are some operation like 
where we adding number to string and string to number whatever addittion we do where ever string start it will treat like string 
for ex 3+2+"2"=52
"2"+3+4=234

there is precedence operator and post increment operator are presen +true will be 1 
+false will be 0
similarly +"" will be 0
