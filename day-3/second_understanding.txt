in comparison we have two type of comparison in javascript == and <,>,<=,>=
these are different type of comparison

simple number comparison is easy
5==6
5<6

problem is when there is different type included 

"5"<6 where 5 is string and 6 is number

comparison <,> and etc convert null to number that is 0 while equalit not that why null>=0 is true and null ==0 is false

"===" this check the datatype of the comparison it shouldnt be same
