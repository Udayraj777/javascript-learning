javascript execution context has global execution context which is in this which is different for browser and server in nodejs it is empty and in browser we have window as global object
their is also function execution context 
their is eval execution context 

how the javascript code execute?
code executed in two phases 
1.memory creation phase
2.execution phase

--code--
let val1=1
let val2=2
function addNum(num1,num2){
    let total=num1+num2
    return total
}
let result1=addNum(val1,val2)
let result2=addNum(10,2)


how would this code will execute->

1.first global execution context created and given to this
2.memory phase -collect all the variable 
val1-undefined
val2-undefined
addNum-definition
result1-undefined
result2-undefined

3.execution phase-assign value to memory
val1-10
val2-5
addNUm already difine function definition in memory phase so their will be no execution for it
move on to result have addnum this addnum will create itself different execution context then repeat everything memory phase and execution phase
memory phase
num1-undefined
num2-undefined 
total-undefined
then execution phase 
num1-10
num2-5
total-15 this will return to global execution context
after returning this new context will be deleted

when we move to result2 then new sandbox will be created same this will repeat
