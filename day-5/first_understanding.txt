first we are working on string today  
string is collection of characters 

in javascript we can declare string simply writing characters inside double or single quotes

ex name="uday"

we concatenate strings with simple + sign 

"uday"+"raj"="udayraj"

we are not going to use this method to concatenate string we going to use `` backtick method 

inside backtick i can insert any variable with string operation inside it 

ex=`my name is ${name} and i work in school`

we can do any operation also like 
ex=`my name is ${name.toUpperCase} and i work in school`
