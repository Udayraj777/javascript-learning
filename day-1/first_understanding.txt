i understand that any file can be code 
compiler and interpreter are the main written software that give that written text or code meaning 
they allow only their certain type of file for example python interpreter will allow only .py 
i think these software (compiler or interpreter ) has their keyword like print that tell computer to print something on screen .
thats why we have different language because we have different usecase low level programming we have compiler performance and flexibility of usecase is reason we have different programming language.
now for javascript this running engine is in browser for many years but node js is the interpreter or js runtime  that make javascript run on any machine. 
we can build any tool with javascript
