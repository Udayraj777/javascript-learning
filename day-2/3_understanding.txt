now we can get the value from anywhere and we dont know the type of that value
we use typeof variable to get the type of variable 

now we want to convert that value in some preferred type like number 
we use assign class 
for ex Numberage= Number(age);
remember we use capital firstletter in datatype for convertion 

now we can convert any value in any type for example if it is not convertible it will convert to that type its value will be NaN
for ex if age="33n" numAge= Number(age);
numAge type is number but value will be NaN 
null when convert to number will be 0
false boolean value when convert to number will be 0 
and true will be 1 vise versa also true for booleans
any string with some character will be Number converted to NaN and any empty string will be converted to 0
