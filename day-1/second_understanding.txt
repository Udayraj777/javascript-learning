to process anything in machine we need to store the information for that every programming language gives us variables.
now in javascript we have three way to store information :
var 
let
const
like we can store any information in javascript 
var name="uday"
let name="uday"
const name="uday"

now const once we assign any value we cant change it
var has scope problem like var variable are global variable they can be changed from anywhere so it is not recommend to use var 
let i dont know about let why it is introduced i know it is introduced to remove scope problem but what it did .
yeah here is the example:
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    // loop
}
console.log(i); // prints 3 - var leaked out

for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    // loop
}
console.log(j); // Error - let stayed inside loop
